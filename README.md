 * Download and unzip [this file](https://github.com/BITSS/Annual2017) into a folder in your desktop.
 * *Optional:* if you want to replicate the section where we produce an output into PDF, you will need to have [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed in your computer (the default version, not the small one).

 * With RStudio, go to `File -> New file -> RMarkdown...` and hit `OK`. Then save the file. Then go to `File -> Knit file`. If it runs without problem you are ready to start. If it asks to install some packages, click OK. If you have any trouble send me [an email](fhoces@berkeley.edu)
